# Crime-stats
A small website made for a university project. Displays QLD crime statistics.
Built using REACT for client side and EXPRESS for server side. The given assignment
was to create a server that interact with a given SQL database to return given endpoints.
A front end was then to be made using these endpoints to graphically display QLD crime stats.

User's had to be able to sort and filter results from the front end. The chosen 
graphical displays were:
- a bubble map showing up to five locations and their corresponding crime frequency
- a line graph showing number of times a given crime was committed in Brisbane over the past five years
- a bar graph comparing toatl number of times a given crime was commited in a given area.

Users could sort information by perpetrater age and gender, year/s, location and crime type. Any mix of these filters could be selected.

As the database information required to run this site belongs to QUT, this project cannot be demo'd remotely.
To supplement this, pictures of the working site have been added.
